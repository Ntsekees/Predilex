# WHAT IS PREDILEX

Predilex is a database of predicates, with definitions in English or other languages, along with cross-referencing with lexical units from several logical languages, semantic categorization and tagging, listing of hypernyms and hyponyms, and a variety of other data.

The data is stored in CSV format in the file `predilex.csv`; for a better visual experience, you may want to copy its content into the Data tab of the `predilex-template.ods` file, which is preformatted for this purpose (with adapted column sizes and color schemes). Don't overwrite this ODS file though; you may want to save it to another filename which won't be tracked by Git, so that you don't need to import from the CSV file every time you want to see the data in the preformatted sheet. If you do that though, please be careful of always saving your changes to the CSV file before pulling changes made by other people in the remote repository, and then import them back to your ODS file, lest you take the risk of overwriting other people's work by mistake later on!
If you open the CSV file in a software such as Libroffice, you may want to select the range `A3:AV50002`, copy its content and past it as text (without copying the formatting) to the aforementioned preformatted ODS sheet.

The Predilex data may also be viewed in readonly in Google Sheets at the following address:
